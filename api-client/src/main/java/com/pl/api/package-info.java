/**
 * Helper interfaces for accessing and testing different APIs provided by Backend module.
 *
 * None of these interfaces are used in real client application as all of the clients are using different languages
 * to interact with the Backend.
 *
 * The main purpose of defining these interfaces is for better understanding and grouping of API methods.
 * Some methods (like /ping) has been duplicated in all interfaces.
